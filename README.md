# NL-SQL_Generation
The following repo contains the codebase for generating SQL queries from user prompt using VANNA AI framework.

Requirements:
*************
1) Download and install ollama and pull the LLM model llama3.1.
2) Install the required libraries mentioned in the ".py" file before you run the code.
3) Once the necessary packages are installed, you can run the code by the command "python LLM_Vanna.py"

Note: The SQL generation can take time to be generated based on the system capability. (Recommended: MAC)

The following framework offers customization as well where you can import your own data. We have used Brazil E-Commerce Dataset Olist.sqlite. You can change the dataset based on your understanding.

SUGGESTION:
